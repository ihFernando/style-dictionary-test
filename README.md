# style-dictionary-test

This is a test with Style-Dictionary + Gitlab + S3.
 
My intention here was building tokens through a pipeline (Gitlab) and sending them to S3 for delivery as a cross-platform.
 
### Next steps:
* Add tag in the pipeline;
* Use Figma API to get the tokens;
* Create a webhook to update S3 when the production board on Figma was saved.
